add a fifth option that says "Don't Know"-> make it if they click "Don't Know" for ALL of the questions, give them a pity point of 1 as the end score.
answering correctly follows up with a "why" before giving the option to move the next question.
questions operate on learning, where information provided in previous questions can maybe help you answer the next ones.
maybe audio for getting it correct and getting it wrong?
maybe voice for questions and answers and the "why" part?
